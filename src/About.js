    <h3>Have you ever read Melinda Gates' book ~ Moment Of Lift?</h3>
    <p>
      She talks about this topic of unpaid labor where women usually do alot of
      unpaid labor like housework, taking care of their kids, making food etc.
      And because of this they are put in a state where it's much more difficult
      for them to find time and energy to actually put effort into working on
      improving themselves. Whether that be getting a job, education or explore
      their own interest etc. What if we made something that can help them track
      thier unpaid labor each day? Reminding they too also have the right to
      improve themselves.
